# Interface Starter Package
This repository provides a complete development web server for frontend structure and styling. JavaScript functionality is available through jQuery and any number of custom scripts can be easily added in the theme files. This framework is designed for use as a prototyping tool or for a static website and is not a complete CMS.

Rather this project provides a suggested structure for how to setup a stylus based project of any size. Several great libraries such as Jeet, Rupture, and nib all are preconfigured to be included and available anywhere stylus code is written. Essential elements are provided based on well known frameworks such as Bootstrap and Materialize to provide a base structure to construct an interface. The overall structure and explanation is available in the included style guide in this repository.

npm i
npm run build
